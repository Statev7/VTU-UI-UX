<h1>Introduction</h1>

This is my CV project, which showcases my skills and experience as a developer. The website is responsive and designed with accessibility in mind, including features for users with visual impairments. The CV is optimized for use with screen readers, and includes an auto-reading feature that is triggered when the user hovers over a particular section of text with their mouse.
